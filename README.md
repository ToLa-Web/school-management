## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

| Tool           | Required for | Download                                       |
| -------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Docker Desktop | Backend      | https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop |
| Flutter SDK    | Mobile app   | https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install   |
| Git            | Cloning      | https://git-scm.com                            |

Minimum: **8 GB RAM**, **20 GB free disk**.

### 1. Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ToLa-Web/school-management.git
cd school-management
```

### 2. Start the backend

```bash
cd backend
docker compose up --build
```

First run takes 3–5 minutes. Wait until all services log `Application started`.

### 3. Run the Flutter app

```bash
cd frontend
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

**Physical device?** Update the IP in `frontend/lib/services/api_config.dart`:

```dart
static const String baseUrl = 'http://YOUR_LAN_IP:5001';
```

Your phone and computer must be on the same Wi-Fi network.

### 4. Verify

| URL                           | What                                      |
